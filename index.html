      <h1> Me </h1>
      <p> I am a man, a husband, father of two. I make my living making computers do what we want from them. </p>


      <h1> Books </h1>
      <p> Those are the books that I wish I had read much earlier than I did. </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628">Ansi C</a>. Best book to understand the <u>basics</u>. The whole world is written in C.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871">SICP</a>. A not too short and weird book in a weird programming language that more or less shows what the whole programming is about.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>. I often wondered how to structure code. How to name stuff. This books gives some solutions to this problem while most other introductory books to programming just skim over that.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997">Effective Java</a>. A book on why using half of stuff in Java is a bad idea.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>. A book on why half of JavaScript are the bad parts.
	</li>
      </ul>
      Now without those two bad halves we finally have our code clean.
