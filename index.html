      <h1> Me </h1>
      <p> I am a man, a husband, father of one. I make my living making computers do what we want from them. </p>


      <h1> Books </h1>
      <p> Those are the books that I wish I had read much earlier than I did. </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628">Ansi C</a>. Best book to understand the <u>basics</u>. The whole world is written in C.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262510871">SICP</a>. A not too short and weird book in a weird programming language that more or less shows what the whole programming is about.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code</a>. I often wondered how to structure Java'esque object code. How to name stuff. This books gives some solutions to this problem while most other introductory books to programming just skim over that.
	</li>
	<li>
	  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997">Effective Java</a>. A book on why using half of stuff in Java is a bad idea.
